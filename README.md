# Blockchain-for-AICTE-Activity-Points.
Activity points are the points every student has to acquire by the end of his last semester, and one can attain these points by taking part in various social, cultural and sustainable activities conducted by the college. But there is no clear record for all these points, which is why we decided to create a blockchain for the activity points.
